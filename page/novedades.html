                    Through a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance to previously unimaginable degrees.
                    As Always, There’s More To Come
                    Since its launch, NVIDIA DLSS has transformed gaming, enabling developers to craft more detailed and immersive games that run smoothly on today’s hardware. Over 240 released games and apps are supported, and each month that number grows ever higher.

                    Now, there’s NVIDIA DLSS 3 and its incredible new Optical Multi Frame Generation technology that multiplies performance, whether bottlenecks are a result of the CPU or GPU. With DLSS 3, you’ll have ultimate performance in every supported game, and the power to enjoy the most demanding fully ray-traced next-gen games, such as Portal with RTX, and Cyberpunk 2077 with its upcoming Ray Tracing: Overdrive mode enabled.

                    Stay tuned to GeForce.com for further information about the release of NVIDIA DLSS 3 for the latest and greatest games, because there are many more to come in the near future.
